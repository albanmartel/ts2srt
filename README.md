# ts2srt
This application is a bash script. It can convert a group of coextensive video files contained in one directory and extract its subtitle SRT file.

It therefore works on GNU / Linux and th√©roriquement, it should also run under Cygwin in Windows and Apple environment (bash syntax might require some adaptation in this case).

This script needs to function:


####ffmpeg
- a collection of free software for processing audio or video stream

####mkvtoolnix (GUI to mkvmerge)
- a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska files

####cuneiform
- optical reconnaissance system multi-language characters

####ogmrip
